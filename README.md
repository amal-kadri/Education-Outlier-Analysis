## Abstract
In an effort to identify patterns in School Performance and student educational attainment, we chose to look at the ways that schools defy prevailing trends. In order to do this, we used OLS to regress classical economic and demographic variables on a School Performance Index that we defined through a Principal Components Analysis of different educational outcomes. We then used Random Forest Regression to predict the Residuals generated by our original linear model. Our analysis is broken down into “overperforming” and “underperforming” schools, schools with positive and negative residuals respectively. We find that Urbanization is a strong but inconsistent contributor educational outcomes for both overperforming and underperforming schools, and that teacher and staff pay are both correlated with higher performance. Overall
our findings lead us to the somewhat unsurprising conclusion that teacher pay tends to be correlated with higher performing students; and that expenditures that take away from teacher pay, either by deliberate reallocation or mismanagement, tend to reduce outcomes. Specific student aid, such as Special Ed Teachers, or Gifted-and-Talented programs, are also correlated with higher attainment for students. Our findings our limited by the masking of student data for privacy considerations, and the relative dearth of data on schools and counties with lower populations (predominantly more rural ones), and would benefit from extension to a national level and more granular data.

## Conclusion
![tree.png](figures/tree.png)

School performance has been heavily researched with many results pointing to household income, racial makeup, and student-to-teacher ratios being the most impactful determinants to high student performance. However, few studies have analyzed the existing pool of over-performing and under-performing schools to determine what differentiates a school that should be performing well, but doesn’t. The state of Texas provides a sufficiently large sample of school districts for such analysis and also features comparatively high racial, urban, and attainment diversity across districts and counties.
A severe limitation to the data was the masking of many of the student fields. The reason the data was masked is because it was available to the public. If certain values were made available it would give anyone the means to impute the identities of students who are in these groups. An unfortunate side effect is the elimination of many fields which could have been descriptive for controlling and predicting education outcome. This included but is not limited to fields like immigration or migrant status, dyslexia, foster care status, homelessness, or military connected. These were among the fields which had to be removed in the cleaning process due to NA values so the variation in these fields was not able to be accounted for. A massive improvement to this study would be to conduct it with access to this masked data, which may need to occur within a state regulatory institution which has clearance to view the information.
A recurring highly explanatory feature was rural coding, particularly when looking at the under andoverachieving districts separately. It is likely part of this explanatory power is due to reduced sample sizes for each of these random forests. This is another reason why this study could benefit from a regional or nationwide comparison, so the rural coding can reduce the impact of outliers by increasing observations from those group. If this feature is explanatory, then having more data to drown out the noise could help better illustrate how urban vs rural environment s effect education outcomes. If the feature is not explanatory then it will drop out of the top 5 for a better fitting parameter. This questions warrants further study but is beyond the scope of our analysis, due to the massive amount of data aggregation which would need to be performed to get the same feature list for all 50 states or even the sunbelt states.
In our study, we find that the share of students eligible for free meals acts as a quasi measure of average household income and an significant indicator for underperformance. In addition, we find that higher average salaries for professional support staff including therapists, counselors, nurses, librarians, and department
heads, tends to be correlated with underperformance, but suffers from a deficiency in data at lower and upper quantiles. We also find a negative correlation with unallocated expenditure per student, with higher shares of a district’s budget spent on items not distributed to specific programs being correlated with underperformance
at shares above 28%. This variable may serve as an indicator of fiscal responsibility, with districts spending large portions of their budgets on unallocated items seeing higher levels of underperformance. We next break down our results further by zeroing in on the most important features that predict over versus under performance. For overperforming districts, we find that the share of students deemed “gifted and talented” is the most important feature and is positively correlated with higher shares indicating higher levels of over-performance. We also find that county-level population change from 2010 to 2020 is a significant predictor, however we find a negative trend in predicting overperformance. We believe that this is another result of flaws in data collection, with the smallest counties with the least number of observations heavily biasing our data. Finally, we observe the percent of district workers that work as auxiliary staff on overperformance and find an overall negative trend, indicating that as the share of auxiliary staff increases, we likely see a corresponding decrease in the share of teachers, which would likely lead to higher student-to-teacher ratios, a classic indicator of lower student performance.
